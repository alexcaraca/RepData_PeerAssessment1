## Introduction

This document pretends to summarize the questions raized within the scope of this assessement.

## Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data

As first step, the input file is read as a .csv. Also, the "date" field" is formatted as date.  
```{r}
setwd("~/ScriptsR/RepData_PeerAssessment1")
Activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", sep = ",",
                       header = TRUE, na.strings = "NA")
dim(Activity)
Activity$date <- as.Date(Activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")

```
  
## Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day  
  
In this step, the histogram with the total number of stpes taken each day is generated as follows:
```{r}
by_day_Activity <- group_by(Activity, date)
Activity_by_day <- as.data.frame(summarise(by_day_Activity, sum.Steps = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE)))
g<-ggplot(Activity_by_day,aes(date,sum.Steps))
g + geom_line() + labs(y = "Steps") + labs(x = "Date") + 
  labs(title="Total Steps per Day")+theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```
  
## Mean and median number of steps taken each day  
   
In the next step the mean and media steps per day are summarized:
```{r}
Activity_by_day2 <- group_by(Activity, date) %>% summarise(Mean.Steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE), Median.Steps = median(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
Activity_by_day2 <- as.data.frame(Activity_by_day2)
Activity_by_day2

```
  
As a remark the median for all the days is zero (when available for calculation).

## Time series plot of the average number of steps taken
  
Now will be generated a plot with the average number of steps.  

```{r}
by_day_Activity <- group_by(Activity, date)
Activity_by_day2 <- as.data.frame(summarise(by_day_Activity, Mean.Steps.1 = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE)))
g1<-ggplot(Activity_by_day2,aes(date,Mean.Steps.1))
g1 + geom_line() + labs(y = "Mean of Steps") + labs(x = "Date") + 
    labs(title="Mean Steps per Day")+theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```







This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
